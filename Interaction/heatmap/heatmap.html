    <h1>Interaction in D3 - Heatmap Example</h1>
    <p>Move your mouse and click on squares to see the interactions.</p>
    <p>
      Borders on divs are to make the layout clearer. Notice how the tooltip div
      attempts to stay within its enclosing div, but can't quite do it when the
      mouse is on a square in the rightmost column.

    <!-- div where the graph will take place -->
    <div id="graph">
      <!-- important that div.tooltip nests inside #graph -->
      <!-- this lets ups position the tooltip based on mouse position -->
      <div class="tooltip"></div>
      <svg></svg>
    </div>
    <!-- important that this nest inside #graph -->
    <div class="info"></div>

      This is example is based on
      <a
        href="https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/interactivity_tooltip.html"
        >an example from d3-graph-gallery.org</a
      >
      but has been updated to use D3 version 5 and modified in several ways.
